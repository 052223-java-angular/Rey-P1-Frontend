# P1 - Java Pokemon Battler

## Introduction

This is a Java and Angular based application that will utilize the Poke API to extract certain information to use in the application. It will allow users to play against a CPU using information from the Poke API. Any data that result from a match will then be stored into a database. This data also includes a login feature for separate accounts to view their match history and compare their win/loss ratio to other unique users that exist in the database. On the backend only, there will exist methods to get Pokemon and various stats from the PokeAPI and calls to a database to get user related information. In the frontend, the game logic will exist to display a grid of Pokemon that a user can call. Each round, the Pokemon will deal damage to each side depending on their typing and stats.

## User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to register an account 
- **As a user**, I want to log in to my account 
- **As a user**, I want to get various Pokemon using the Poke API
- **As a user**, I want to view my win loss ratio
- **As a user**, I want to view a leaderboard of all the users given a match history
- **As a user**, I should win/lose a match and should get that reflected on my user stats
- **As a user** I want to fight against another opponent with 6 random Pokemon
- **As a user** I want to be able to view my opponent's 6 random Pokemon
- **As a user** I want my Pokemon's stats to reflect those found in the API

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- User registration and login
- Giving user random Pokemon name and stats
- Have a Pokemon Model that translates API data to usable data
- Leaderboard that can see various information from users
- Win/Losing a game reflects on the User stats
- Pokemon Typing allows users to deal more or less damage to another Pokemon
- Damage calculation is done by comparing defense and attack, then 80 + subtracting that difference by the hp * any modifiers.
- Allow user to change password
- Allow user to fight against another player with 6 random Pokemon

## Stretch Goals

- Adding an admin role that can add, remove, or modify Pokemon API interpretations
- Adding more moves that Pokemon can do
- Adding an evolution feature if a valid Pokemon can evolve
- Adding a unique battle feature that can increase Pokemon's power (Mega Evolution, Z-Move, etc)
- Add multiplayer with another player
- Add a chat feature between another player

## Tech Stacks

- **Java**: One of the main programming languages used for building the application.
- **Spring**: A framework used for the ease of integrating REST APIs
- **Typescript**: The front end logic of the application.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the database to store user, product, and order data.
- **Maven or Gradle**: Used for managing project dependencies.
- **JUnit**: A testing framework for Java applications, used to ensure our code works as expected.
- **Log4j**: A logging utility for debugging purposes.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: An API for connecting and executing queries on the database.
- **BCrypt**: A Java library for hashing and checking passwords for security.
- **JUnit, Mockito, and PowerMock**: Used for unit and integration testing.
- **Git and GitHub**: Used for version control.

## Requirements

- **Clean Codebase**: All code should be clean and well-documented. The repository should not include any unnecessary files or folders such as the `target/`, `.DS_Store`, etc. All files and directories should be appropriately named and organized.

- **Database Design**: The database should be designed following the principles of the 3rd Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity and efficiency. An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) should be included in the documentation.

- **Secure**: All sensitive user data such as passwords must be securely hashed before storing it in the database. The application should not display any sensitive information in error messages.

- **Error Handling**: The application should handle potential errors gracefully and provide clear and helpful error messages to the users.

- **Testing**: The application should have a high test coverage. Unit tests and integration tests should be implemented using JUnit, Mockito, and PowerMock.

- **Version Control**: The application should be developed using a version control system, preferably Git, with regular commits denoting progress.

- **Documentation**: The repository should include a README file with clear instructions on how to run the application. Code should be well-commented to allow for easy understanding and maintenance.

- **Scalable**: The design of the application should be scalable, allowing for easy addition of new features or modifications in the future.
